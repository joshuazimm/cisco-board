This was a place I could store working drafts for the webscraping portion of the hdc-dashboard project. Changes were done outside of the other repo to avoid clutter.

Using pyppeteer, bs4, and python, i scrape a current cisco provided callboard for data to use in our callboard because they do not have an accessible API endpoint for the data we need. We authenticate using netID credentials and incorporate error checking to make sure things have loaded corectly
